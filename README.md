## My process

small practice of a qr component

### Built with

- css
- html

### What I learned

I put on practice my css learnings, I read a little more and since I'm using frameworks I wanted to take the time to fully develop this in order to practice a little.
I tried to implement a reactive design, b ut the component is simple enough to leave it as it is. Still, this made me read more about responsive design

### Continued development

I will put more effort in my next projects since I feel like using frameworks made me forgot that sometime css has already implemented powerful tools to archive the same effects.
Quoting Zenshi from dungeon meshi: "When you make something easier, you may lose your edge in a skill. Convenience and ease aren't the same thing."
